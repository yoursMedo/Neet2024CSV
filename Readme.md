# NEET SCAM CSV Files and PDF

On 18th July 2024, the honorable Supreme Court of India ordered the National Testing Agency (NTA) to release center and state-wise marks of students who participated in the National Eligibility Entrance Examination (NEET) for Undergraduate Students. This exam is the single undergraduate entrance medical exam in the country, whose sanctity was allegedly compromised nationwide.

## Beyond the Media Rhetoric
Although I am learning low-level programming and app development, I undertook the task of scraping the more than 4000 PDF files containing these marks from the NTA website and converting them into CSV files. For this purpose, I used ChatGPT to generate code that scanned the 4000+ PDF files and produced a CSV file in the following format:

- **Center Number:** The number of the center.
- **State Name:** The state in which the exam was held. This is occasionally missing in the file, but its absence does not significantly detract from the file's usefulness.
- **Srl No:** The serial number.
- **Marks:** The marks scored by the corresponding serial number in the given center.

The code generated by ChatGPT isn't perfect, as expected of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, I hope that this time and resource-consuming process could prove useful for data analysis or serve as demo data for other computing endeavors.
